# User-Identification-Using-Walking-Patterns
This code implements the novel Convolutional Neural Network-based approach for user identification based on their walking activity.  we have uploaded files as follows:
 1. Purposed CNN-model for user identification.
 2. Classical machine learning algorithms implemneted code.
 3. Walking-activity Dataset
